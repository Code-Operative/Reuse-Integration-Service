# Reuse-Integration-Service
This module allows Reuse Home shop owners to sell their products cross-platform 

In the front office, it allows the shop owner to sign it to their eBay account and link it with Reuse Home. This can be done when signing up as a Shop owner or later on within the profile information. Afterwards, when adding a product from the products tab in Reuse Home it will publish the product on to their eBay account and list the product within eBay's store. Subsequenetly, it will also be removed, if removed from Reuse Home or editted the same. 

The back office uses an API to make a call, publishing specific fields to the eBay account that is linked. It also checks for a sale within one of the stores, marking it as sold on them, to allow for no double sales on either platform.
